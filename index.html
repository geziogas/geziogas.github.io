<p>George is currently studying MSc in Computer Science program (120 ECTS) at Uppsala University/Department of Information Technology (Sweden) and is about to graduate after the implementation of his master thesis project.</p>

<p>He received his bachelor degree in Computer Science (Department of Informatics, Faculty of Sciences) at Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, specialized in Networks, Communications and Computer Architecture (245 ECTS / 90 ECTS in Specialization). </p>

<p>Subject of his bachelor thesis project was the” computational analysis of the intracellular signaling pathway of EGFR”, part of a research conducted by the academic group "NeuroInformatics.GRoup" (<a href="http://www.neuroinformatics.gr">www.neuroinformatics.gr</a>) and AIIA(Artificial Intelligence and Information Analysis) Laboratory (<a href="http://www.aiia.csd.auth.gr/EN/">www.aiia.csd.auth.gr/EN/</a>), that he continued after graduation and led him to a publication at PLOSone journal (<a href="http://www.plosone.org">www.plosone.org</a>)</p>

<p>In December 2015, George finished his 9-month mandatory military service in Communications Corps of the Greek army where he had positions such as IT-support, Network Security Administrator, and Wireless Nodes maintenance.</p>

<p>Fields that he is really interested in are machine learning, data analytics, graph theory, digital signal processing, wireless networks, image processing, complex network analysis, biosignals analysis.</p>

<p>George is a person that really enjoys professional challenges, that carries out solving different kind of problems at his work. Furthermore, he is passionate about technology and computer science which motivates him to learn even more things every day, in order to follow the technology evolution and be prepared for all the real challenges.</p>

<p>At the moment, he is looking for an inspiring and creative job position, which will give him the chance to apply his knowledge but also gain experience from professionals, in a way that can help and have direct positive impact on the society.</p>
